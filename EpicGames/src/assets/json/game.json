        "about_game": "Based on the style of the studio's successful Borderlands, the game adds a fantasy element to the looting shooters we're familiar with and provides powerful firepower to your fingertips that make you feel like you're wearing infinity gloves. Full of sillyness and always trying to make you laugh, Little Tina's Fantasy Land has a unique charm that takes care of the characters and the world to immerse you in a journey you don't want to end. At the beginning of the game, the protagonist Tiny Tina invites several of her friends to play a tabletop game called Bunker & Badass, a version of Borderlands' Dungeons & Dragons. Tina is the dungeon lord in the game, and you're the newest member of the team — you design heroes that delve into the details of your class skills and facial features.",

The game's art was created in collaboration with Vietnamese animation studio Sparx, and its fictional world is inspired by Eastern locations such as Japan and Bali.

Some of Vampire's central themes of the power of belief developed out of Rein-Hagen's religious upbringing. Inspired by a comic book given to him by White Wolf business partner Stewart Wieck, Rein-Hagen developed the idea that the cursed character of the Biblical Cain was the original vampire. In an Ask Me Anything interview on Reddit Rein-Hagen referred to the idea of Cain as the progenitor of all vampires as a big turning point. He commented further: I was trying to shy away from religion. After that... I went all in. The game and the world became about religion and belief. My father was a Lutheran minister, and I think that played a huge role in not only Vampire but the whole WoD series. I was always fascinated by what made people believe so strongly when I didn't seem to believe at all. Talking about that theme, the power of belief, fueled the second half of Vampire game design.",

Mark Delaney of GameSpot gave the game a score of 6 out of 10, praising its faithfulness to the Evil Dead franchise and class-based character design while criticizing the progression as slow, story missions as undeveloped, and PvP combat as unbalanced.[22] Jordan Gerblick of GamesRadar+ commended the game's approachability, graphics, and homages made to the franchise while taking issue with the lack of content, difficulty in single-player missions, and the lack of more traversal options. Travis Northup of IGN gave the game 8 out of 10, writing, Evil Dead: The Game is an awesome asymmetric multiplayer game that, like its source material, is far better than it has any right to be given its frustrating lack of polish and being somewhat light on maps and modes.",

It received critical acclaim, with praise directed at its multiple protagonist design, open world, presentation and gameplay. However, it caused controversies related to its depiction of violence and women. Considered one of seventh and eighth generation console gaming's most significant titles and among the best video games ever made, it won year-end accolades including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. It is the second best-selling video game of all time with over 169 million copies shipped, and as of April 2018, one of the most financially successful entertainment products of all time, with about $6 billion in worldwide revenue.",

Rogue became popular in the 1980s among college students and other computer-savvy users in part due to its inclusion in 4.2BSD. It inspired programmers to develop a number of similar titles such as Hack (1982/1984) and Moria (1983), though as Toy, Wichman, and Arnold had not released the source code at this time, these new games introduced different variations atop Rogue. A long lineage of games grew out from these titles. While Rogue was not the first dungeon-crawling game with procedural generation features, it introduced the subgenre of roguelike RPG procedurally generated dungeon crawlers with Dungeons-and-Dragons-like items (armor, weapons, potions, and magic scrolls) that also had permadeath (permanent death) and an overhead graphical view — albeit via ASCII drawings, as opposed to text descriptions in natural language such as in Adventure/Colossal Cave",

The Starfleet Command game series released by Interplay was based largely on the tabletop game Star Fleet Battles, and comprised Starfleet Command, Starfleet Command II: Empires at War, and Starfleet Command III. It constitutes one of the most definitive current games, depicting a wide array of ship systems and Star Trek storylines. This series had a more naval flavor, and depicted a number of ship systems. This series spawned a very large multiplayer ladder competition first with the Starlance system, and later on the GamerZone ladder. The main multiplayer setting is the Dynaverse which began as an official server hosted by Taldren, and has continued as a private effort (an earlier, unauthorized adaptation of Star Fleet Battles as a computer game was SSI's The Warp Factor in 1982).",

In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island where they scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill other players while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into an ever tightening space to force encounters. The last surviving player (or team) wins the round. It is the first game in the PUBG Universe series.",
